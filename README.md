# Team Profile Generator

## Description

This team profile generator works through the command line by asking a series of questions. The information submitted is saved as classes for different roles, which are a subclass of Employee. After the questions are answered, the generator takes the answer classes and applies the information to an HTML file and, along with copying over an accompanying CSS file, outputs it into the /dist folder.
